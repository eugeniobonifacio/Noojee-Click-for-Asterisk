All javascripts contained in this folder were originally developed by
Noojee (http://www.noojee.com.au/), as a Firefox extension 
(Noojee click for Asterisk).

Thanks to the GPL license, it was possible to re-use the source code
to develop this Google Chrome extension. The original source code
can be found on that address: 
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/files/browse/138464/

The code has been adapted to work with Chrome.
Sven also renamed all "nj" and "noojee" functions / classes to make the code
more genereric and re-usable.
